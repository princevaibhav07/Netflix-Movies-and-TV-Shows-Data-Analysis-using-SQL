# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis 📊🎥

Welcome to the Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis project! This repository showcases how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from a dataset containing Netflix's catalog of movies and TV shows. Dive in to see the magic of data-driven storytelling! 🚀

## 📝 Project Overview

The Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset contains information on the titles, genres, release years, ratings, and countries of origin. This project involves writing and executing SQL queries to analyze the dataset and answer key questions about Netflix's content library.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

Analyze the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows.

Identify the most common content ratings.

Explore the top countries producing Netflix content.

Find the longest movie in the Netflix catalog.

Filter content based on specific directors.

Count the number of items in each genre.

Identify TV shows with more than 5 seasons.

Track trends in content release by year (with a focus on Indian content).

Categorize content based on the presence of specific keywords (e.g., "kill," "violence").

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

SQL: Core technology used to query and analyze the dataset.
